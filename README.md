# Happy Thoughts

*UPDATE 2021-05-24:Â Now I have added my own API endpoints to this project. Se my backend project project-happy-thoughts-api.

The goal of this project was to practice React states by fetching and posting data to an API. The API was already created. We were also given a design to implement. The result, Happy Thoughts, lets you post your happy thought for others to read and like. 

## The problem

Using the study material and lectures of this week I found this project easy to make. I put focus in getting the design right. I took measures and color picks from the design example using the PixelZoomer Chrome extension. The vibrant spring green background is my own addition. I think it adds to the nice retro feel of the design. 

I noticed that longer texts didn't fit into the message card from the design. (The words went under the heart button). So I chose to set maxLength = "120" on the text-input and also only show three rows of the message, even if the API allows them to be longer... I prioritized appearance over content there. Had it been a real project I think we would have matched the design with the API, in this case they did not match from the start.
