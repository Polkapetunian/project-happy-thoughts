TODO: clean text input after submitting!!!

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I chose to set maxLength = "120" on the text-input so that the text message on the card wouldn't be covered by the heart-button. I also set word-break to break-word, so that all messages would stay inside the card.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
